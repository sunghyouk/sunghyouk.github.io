## 12.1 Frequentist and Bayesian paradigms

### 12.1.1 Alternate definitions of p-values and confidence intervals

1) A p-value is the probability of observing more extreme data given that the null hypothesis is correct.
2) A 95% confidence interval is an interval that contains the true value on 95% of occasions, if the random process could be repeated many times.

Alternative, rely on just the actual observed data.  

1) A p-value is the estimated probability that the null hypothesis is true, given the observed data.
2) A 95% CI is an interval that contains the true value with a probability of 0.95

### 12.1.2 Bayes' equation

* Equation 12.1
$$P(\theta|\mathbf{y})=\frac{P(\mathbf{y}|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(\mathbf{y})}$$

* Equation 12.2
$$P(\theta|\mathbf{y})\propto P(\mathbf{y}|\theta)P(\theta)$$

posterior probability of $\theta$, $P(\theta|\mathbf{y})$, as a function of the likelihood,  
and prior, $P(\theta)$.  

Under Bayesian methodology the parameter is a random variable and the data are fixed.

### 12.1.3 Parameter space

This range of possible values is called the parameter space and is denoted by $\Theta$.  
* Equation 12.3
$$P(\theta|\mathbf{y})=\frac{P(\mathbf{y}|\theta)P(\theta)}{\sum P(\mathbf{y}|\theta)P(\theta)}$$

Bayes' equation evaluates the combination of likelihood and prior of a specific value for $\theta$ relative to every other value.  

### 12.1.4 Example: Schistosoma japonicum

## 12.2 Priors

Bayesian methodology = prior + observed data to create posterior.  
Equation 12.2 shows that the posterior estimate of $\theta$ is dependent on a combination of the data and the prior probability.  
If the prior is constant for all values of $\theta$ so that $P(\theta)=c$ - uniformative prior

### 12.2.1 Informative priors
