# Preface

This book is about how to build and use machine learning models in artificial intelligence applications when the data are scattered across different sites, owned by different individuals or organizations, and there is no easy solution to bring the data together.

## Foundation for the technology

* distributed optimization and learning
* homomorphic encryption
* differential privacy
* secure multi-party computation

## Two types of federated learning

* horizontal - B2C
* vertical - B2B where multiple organization join an alliance in building and using a shared ML model

It is written for students in computer science, AI, and ML, as well as for big data and AI application developers.
