## 11.1 Introduction

The term repeated measures is used to describe both longitudinal and clustered data.  
1) Dropping the usual assumption of independence - repeated measures and the generalized estimating equation approach
2) multilevel modelling - outcomes at the same level are assumed to be independent and the correlation is a result of the multilevel structure.

It is necessary to choose a correlation structure likely to reflect the relationships between the observations.  
Correlation parameters - in order to obtain consistent estimates of those parameters that are of interest and to correctly calculate the SE of these estimates.  

Multilevel models - by fixed parameters (e.g., for group effect) or random variables (E.g., for subjects randomly allocated to groups). - mixed model  

## 11.2 Example: Recovery from stroke

A naive analysis, sometimes called a pooled analysis, of these data is to fit an analysis of covariance model.  
* Equation 11.1  
$$E(Y_{ijk}) = \alpha_i + \beta t_k + e_{ijk}$$
