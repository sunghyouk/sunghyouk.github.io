# Adversarial interference and its mitigations in privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning

## Abstract

Here we present an overview and analysis of current adversarial attacks and their mitigations in the context of collaborative ML.  
We discuss the applicability of attack vectors to specific learning contexts and attempt to formulate a generic foundation for adversarial influence and mitigation mechanisms.  
We moreover show that a number of context-specific learning conditions are exploited in similar fashion across all settings.  
Lastly, we provide a focused perspective on open challenges and promising areas of future research in the field.
