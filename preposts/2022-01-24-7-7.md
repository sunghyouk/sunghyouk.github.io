# Chatper 7.7 Other diagnostics

For binary or binomial data, the first is to check the choice of the link function.  
$$g(\pi,\alpha)=\log\left[\frac{(1-\pi)^{-\alpha}-1}{\alpha}\right]$$
optimal value of $\alpha$ can be estimated from the data  
The second issue in assessing the adequacy of models for binary or binomial data is **overdispersion**.  

If the deviance $D$ is much greater than the expected value of $N-p$. due to inadequate specification of the model (e.g., relevant explanatory variables have been omitted or the link function is incorrect) or to a more complex structure.  
*Solution)* $\phi$ in the model so that var$(Y_i)=n_i\pi_i(1-\pi_i)\phi$.: quasibinomial distribution
