 # Chapter 8. Nomial and ordinal logistic regression

## 8.1 Introduction

If the response variable is categorical, with more than two categories.  
One relies on generalization of logistic regression from dichotomous responses, to nomial or ordinal responses with more than two categories. (GOTO: Chapter 7.)  
The other option is to model the frequencies or counts for the covariate pattern as the response variables with Poisson distributions. - **log-linear modelling** (GOTO: Chapter 9.)  

One of the measured or observed categorical variables is regarded as the response, and all other variables are explanatory variables.  

Whether one variable is clearly a "response" or several variables have the same status.  
How the results are to be presented and interpreted.

## 8.2 Multinomial distribution

Consider a random variable $Y$ with $J$ categories. Let $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$, ..., $\pi_J$ denote the respective probabilities.  
The Multinomial distribution is (Equation 8.1):
