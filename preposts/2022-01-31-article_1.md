# Threats to federated learning

## Abstract

Existing FL protocol design has been shown to exhibit vulnerabilities which can be exploited by adversaries both within and outside of the system to compromise data privacy.  
Two major attacks on FL: 1) poisoning attacks and 2) inference attacks  

## 1. Introductionc

Federated learning which pushes model training to the devices from which data originate emerged as a promising alternative ML paradigm.  
It can handle unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data which naturally arise in the real world.  

### 1.1 Types of FL

Under HFL, datasets owned by each participant share similar features but concern different users.  
* H2B (Business): small numbers of participants, training frequently, high technical capability - *Example)* Google's GBoard application
* H2C (Consumer): large numbers of participants, not frequent training, low technical capability

VFL is applicable to the cases in which participants have large overlaps in the sample space but differ in the feature space. VFL mainly targets business participants.  
FTL deals with scenarios in which FL participants have little overlap in both the sample space and the feature space.

### 1.2 Threats to FL

A more recent work showed that the malicious attacker can completely steal the training data from gradients in a few iteration (NOTE: Next article).  
FL protocol desings may contain vulnerabilities for both (1) the (potentially malicious) server, (2) any participant.  
In particular, we focus on two specific threats initiated by the insiders on FL systems: 1) **poisoning attacks**; and 2) **inference attacks**.  

## 2. Threat models

We first present a summary of the threat models.
