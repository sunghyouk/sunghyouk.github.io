vector의 geometric vectors - length, distance 또는 angle 계산

## 3.1 Norms

`Def 3.1` (Norm)

## 3.2 Inner products

length of vector and the angle or distance between two vectors  
major purpose: to determine whether vectors are orthogonal to each other.  

### 3.2.1 Dot product

$$ x^{\top}y = \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i y_i}$$  
하지만, inner product는 특정 속성을 지닌 더 일반적인 개념이다.

### 3.2.2 General inner products
