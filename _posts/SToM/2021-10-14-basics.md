## Chapter 4. SNOMED CT basics

### 4.1 Introduction

- SNOMED CT는 concept으로서 존재하는 모든 것을 다룬다.  
  어떠한 임상 관찰은 실제로 임상적인 생각과 통찰이다. 하지만, 단일 concept은 많은 다른 방법으로 표현될 수 있다.  
  이 용어 집합은 가능한 명확하게 임상가의 임상적 생각을 포착하기에 충분할 정도로 광범위하고 유연해야 한다.  
  심지어 하나의 용어가 아닌 몇 용어의 조합도 허용해야 한다.
- SNOMED CT는 의학 용어에 대한 참조 용어이며 보건 의료에서 사용되는 용어들로 구성된다.  
  These terms are attached to the concept codes, with **multiple terms per code** that are designated to mean special things.  
  The concepts themselves are structured/ according to descriptiion **logic-based representation** of meanings/ that each concept conveys/ through a set of relationships.

### 4.2 Logical model

The core component types in SNOMED CT are `concepts`, `description` and `relationships`.  
The logical model therefore specifies/ a structured representation of the concepts/ used to represent clinical meaning,/ the descriptions used to describe them/ and the relationships between the concepts.

![logicalModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89435559/137333295-c44c7e13-6900-4100-a21d-77d62d3cf2b1.png)

Each of these components has an associated SNOMED CT identifier that is unique to it.  
Concepts are each linked to descriptions and relationships/ via the concept identifier.

Descriptions are therms that are either fully specified name (**FSN**) or synonyms.  
One synonym is marked as 'preferred' in each language and is called **PT** (preferred term).  
The other synonym, which may be unlimied for any single concept, are marked as 'acceptable'.

#### 4.2.1 Concepts

Concepts - clinical idea with a unique identifier - corresponding unique numeric code: a unit of meaning  
one code per meaning, one meaning per code  
machine-processable digits with length from 6 to 18, although most commonly 8 or 9 digits (SCTID data type)  
hierarchical organization - `directed acyclic graph`

- no circular relationships
- unidirectional without any exception
- (가능성) more than one outgoing arrow

#### 4.2.2 Description

corresponding human-readable component  
at least two associated terms

- fully specified name (FSN)
- the other, acceptable

##### 4.2.2.1 Fully specified name

always ending with a schematic tag, associated topmost-level hierarchy, being enclosed in parenthesis  
topmost-level positioned just below the root concept  
uniquely describe a concept and clarify its meaning (하지만, 자주 사용되거나 자연스레 나오는 구문은 아님)  
only one in a given language or dialect (영어에 하나, 한국에 하나 등등 국가 별 언어에 하나)
original FSN (영어)은 conflicting meaning이 있을 때 ultimate source of reference

##### 4.2.2.2 Acceptable

not having any schematic tag ending  
`preferred term` and is language specific - for one language only one PT  
no limit on the number of synonyms or 'acceptable' terms

#### 4.2.3 Relationships

represent an association between two concepts and are used to logically define the meaning of concept  
일단 큰 범주로 나눠보자면,

1. definitional - define the concepts through a number of **| is a |** _subtype_ and **has a** _attribute_ relationships
2. non-definitional - additional information or functionality
