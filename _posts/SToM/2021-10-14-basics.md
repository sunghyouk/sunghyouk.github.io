## Chapter 4. SNOMED CT basics

### 4.1 Introduction

- SNOMED CT는 concept으로서 존재하는 모든 것을 다룬다.  
  어떠한 임상 관찰은 실제로 임상적인 생각과 통찰이다. 하지만, 단일 concept은 많은 다른 방법으로 표현될 수 있다.  
  이 용어 집합은 가능한 명확하게 임상가의 임상적 생각을 포착하기에 충분할 정도로 광범위하고 유연해야 한다.  
  심지어 하나의 용어가 아닌 몇 용어의 조합도 허용해야 한다.
- SNOMED CT는 의학 용어에 대한 참조 용어이며 보건 의료에서 사용되는 용어들로 구성된다.  
  These terms are attached to the concept codes, with **multiple terms per code** that are designated to mean special things.  
  The concepts themselves are structured/ according to descriptiion **logic-based representation** of meanings/ that each concept conveys/ through a set of relationships.

### 4.2 Logical model

The core component types in SNOMED CT are `concepts`, `description` and `relationships`.  
The logical model therefore specifies/ a structured representation of the concepts/ used to represent clinical meaning,/ the descriptions used to describe them/ and the relationships between the concepts.

![logicalModel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89435559/137333295-c44c7e13-6900-4100-a21d-77d62d3cf2b1.png)

Each of these components has an associated SNOMED CT identifier that is unique to it.  
Concepts are each linked to descriptions and relationships/ via the concept identifier.

Descriptions are therms that are either fully specified name (**FSN**) or synonyms.  
One synonym is marked as 'preferred' in each language and is called **PT** (preferred term).  
The other synonym, which may be unlimied for any single concept, are marked as 'acceptable'.

#### 4.2.1 Concepts

Concepts - clinical idea with a unique identifier - corresponding unique numeric code: a unit of meaning  
one code per meaning, one meaning per code  
machine-processable digits with length from 6 to 18, although most commonly 8 or 9 digits (SCTID data type)  
hierarchical organization - `directed acyclic graph`

- no circular relationships
- unidirectional without any exception
- (가능성) more than one outgoing arrow

#### 4.2.2 Description

corresponding human-readable component  
at least two associated terms

- fully specified name (FSN)
- the other, acceptable

##### 4.2.2.1 Fully specified name

always ending with a schematic tag, associated topmost-level hierarchy, being enclosed in parenthesis  
topmost-level positioned just below the root concept  
uniquely describe a concept and clarify its meaning (하지만, 자주 사용되거나 자연스레 나오는 구문은 아님)  
only one in a given language or dialect (영어에 하나, 한국에 하나 등등 국가 별 언어에 하나)
original FSN (영어)은 conflicting meaning이 있을 때 ultimate source of reference

##### 4.2.2.2 Acceptable

not having any schematic tag ending  
`preferred term` and is language specific - for one language only one PT  
no limit on the number of synonyms or 'acceptable' terms

#### 4.2.3 Relationships

represent an association between two concepts and are used to logically define the meaning of concept  
일단 큰 범주로 나눠보자면,

1. `definitional` - define the concepts through a number of **| is a |** _subtype_ and **has a** _attribute_ relationships
2. `non-definitional` - additional information or functionality  
(a) Qualifying - be added to refine the concept  
(b) historical - provides historical pointers  
(c) additional - allows additional information  

`attribute` - providing a more precise definition to a concept  

### 4.3 Concept model

#### 4.3.1 SNOMED CT hierarchies

inverted tree with the root at the top  
this root concept has as its own unique concept identifier called **ConceptID** and is **138875005**.  
The FSN of this concept is **SNOMED CT Concept**.  
This root branches into 19 top-level hierarchies.  
이 hierarchies에 clinical findings, observable entities, procedures 등이 포함된다.

|is a| relationship is unidirectional, going from child to parent.  
The child is a **subtype** of the parent. The converse however is `not true`.  

additional has a-type relationships: help provide clarity to the meaning as possible.  
It must be noted that although all concepts have at least one |is a| subtype relationship to its `immediate supertype` concepts, not all concepts have attributes.  

The term `granurity`: represents the degree to which the terminolgy includes highly specific terms.  

바로 위  concept: immediate proximal `supertype` concept  
바로 아래 concept: immediate proximal `subtype` concept  

all terms in the tree above the immediate proximal `supertype` concept: `supertype ancestors`  
all terms below the immediate proximal `subtype` concept: `subtype descendant`  
just one definition of |is a|: `primitive concept` - 아래 4.3.2에도 나오지만 연결된 concept의 추가로 의미를 명확히 해야 하는 concept이다.  

하위 concept은 상위 concept을 포함하지 않는다.  

All concepts from |pain/sensation finding| to |clinical finding| are its supertypes and constitute its `transitive closure` (**전이적/추이적 폐포**), with the root concept of |SNOMED CT Concept| being assumed to be implicitly included during any consideration of such transitive closure.  

*reference)* Floyed-Warshall Algorithm  
[플로이드-워셜 알고리즘]<https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/플로이드-워셜_알고리즘>
이 알고리즘은 transitive closure나 다대다 최단 거리 (n:n shortest path)를 구할 때 사용하는 알고리즘, 동적 계획법 기법이 포함되어 있다.  
transitive closure란 간접적으로 연결되어 있는 간선을 직접갈 수 있는 간선을 추가한 그래프이다.  
즉, 이 그래프는 정점이 서로 직접 혹은 간접적으로 연결되어 있냐를 확인할 수 있다.  

*Note*: Not only is one concept related to another, several relationships between concepts can exist together.  

#### 4.3.2 Definitional relationships

*fully defined* concept is one that requires no further refinement. In effect, its definition is *sufficient* to distinguish it from all other concepts related to it.  
*primitive concetp* is one that is incompletely defined. These are *not sufficient enough* to completely clarify the meaning of what it represents.  

*note* fully defined concepts can be recorded as is, while primitive concepts need to be refined in order to fully convey the clinical idea of an observation.
