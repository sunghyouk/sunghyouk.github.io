## 6.5 Analysis of covariance

* Definition

Some of the explanatory variables are dummy variables representing factor levels and others are continuous measurements called **covariates**.  
  * We compare the means after *adjustment* for covairate effects.

```R
# In achieve dataset
res.glm = glm(y ~ x + method, family=gaussian, data=achieve)
```
